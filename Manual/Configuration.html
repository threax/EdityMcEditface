<h1>Configuration</h1>
<p>There are 2 major modes for Edity McEditface to run under local and hosted. The repostiory has the local mode program inside and you can consume the NuGet packages to get hosted mode to work.</p>
<h2>Local Mode</h2>
<p>Edity McEditface can run in a local mode where the webserver is started and you edit files on your computer. You can collaborate with others by sharing the git repositories. When the program is launched it will choose a random port, start the server on http and open your default browser to the editor. This will run until you click shutdown in the gui. Files will be served/edited through the current working directory when the program is started.</p>
<ul>
	<li><code><font face="Courier New">--workingDir=PATH</font></code> Use PATH as the working dir for the program. Otherwise this defaults to the current working directory.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Hosted Mode</h2>
<p>Hosted mode allows you to run the cms more like a traditional hosted cms. To do this consume the NuGet packages and call AddEdity and UseEdity in your startup.cs.</p>
<h2>Common Configuration</h2>
<p>No matter if you are using a local or hosted build the configuration works more or less the same way.</p>
<h3>appsettings.json</h3>
<p>This file is the default Asp.net Core configuration file. In addition to the standard settings for logging and site configuration provided by that file you can create an additional section called EditySettings that looks like the following:</p>
<p><code>&quot;EditySettings&quot;: {
	<br />&nbsp; &quot;ReadFromCurrentDirectory&quot;: false,
	<br />&nbsp; &quot;DetailedErrors&quot;: false,
	<br />&nbsp; &quot;Compiler&quot;: &quot;Direct&quot;,
	<br />&nbsp; &quot;ProjectPath&quot;: &quot;..\\Manual&quot;,
	<br />&nbsp; &quot;OutputPath&quot;: &quot;..\\ManualOutput&quot;,
	<br />&nbsp; &quot;SiteName&quot;: null,
	<br />&nbsp; &quot;AppHostConfigPath&quot;: null,
	<br />&nbsp; &quot;ProjectMode&quot;: &quot;OneRepo&quot;
	<br />}</code></p>
<p>The meanings of each variable are as follows:</p>
<ul>
	<li><strong>ReadFromCurrentDirectory </strong>- Determines if the server settings, which are in another file, can be read from the current working directory or must be read from the application directory. In hosted mode you should make this false and in local mode it sould be true.</li>
	<li><strong>DetailedErrors </strong>- True to show stack traces and other detailed info if a server error occures. Ideally false for production.</li>
	<li><strong>Compiler </strong>- &quot;Direct&quot; or &quot;RoundRobin&quot; - Defaults to Direct
	<ul>
		<li><strong>Direct </strong>- Directly compile the website to the OutputPath. OutputPath will be deleted each time a new compile occures. This is best for local mode where you will upload the website output somewhere as a separate step.</li>
		<li><strong>RoundRobin </strong>- Outputs the site into a randomly created subfolder of OutputPath. When the compilation is complete a web.config will be generated in the root with rewrite rules to point to the new instance. This keeps the content online even during a recompile.</li>
	</ul></li>
	<li><strong>ProjectPath </strong>- The path to the root project folder.</li>
	<li><strong>BackupFilePath </strong>- The path that &quot;backup&quot; files come out of. This is the directory that Edity will use to serve up the files that it needs for a&nbsp;project that are not included in your local project. This is things like the default layout, templates, editors and content files like css and javascript that make the editor work. It is extremely unlikely that you would change this.</li>
	<li><strong>ProjectMode </strong>- &quot;OneRepo&quot; or &quot;OneRepoPerUser&quot; - Defaults to OneRepo
	<ul>
		<li><strong>OneRepo </strong>- Use a single content repository for all editors of the website. Useful in local mode, since that likely syncs somewhere else, but also useful if hosting with just one user.</li>
		<li><strong>OneRepoPerUser </strong>- Use a set of content directories for each user of the website. These are synchronized through a master repo and publised through a published repo. This is the reccomended mode for hosted websites, especially those with multiple users.</li>
	</ul></li>
	<li><strong>OutputPath </strong>- The path to the root output folder.</li>
</ul>
