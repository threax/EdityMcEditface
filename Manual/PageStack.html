<h1>Page Stack</h1>
<p>Edity McEditface uses a convention when building pages where any page (.html) file can have a javascript (.js), style sheet (.css) and a settings file (.json) with the same file name will be gathered up and used as a single page. When the content renders a stack is created starting at the content page and adding each layout defined in the settings above that up to the default layout that provides the main site structure.</p>

<p>This graphic shows the page stack. The arrows point up the stack starting at the individual page on the bottom&nbsp;to the default.html master layout at the top. Each file in the page stack can define its own content files the same way the page file does. Any variables defined in the stack will be overwritten by the item that is lower on the stack, so a variable in a page file overrides a variable in a layout file. Any&nbsp;linked content specified at any point in the stack will be included in the final render only once even if it is defined multiple times.</p>
<h2>Creating Layout Files</h2>
<p>Layout files are how you create a common site layout without having to do it on each page. The main required thing that is needed in one of these files is a <strong>mainContent </strong>variable that determines where the page below this one in the stack goes in this layout. By building your pages this way it should be easy to open and close your html tags in the same file. If you don&#39;t want the next page in the stack to be nested inside the layout, but instead chained onto the end of that layout, put your <strong>mainContent </strong>variable after the closing tag. There is no implied hierarchy that the files must follow for their html, the stack is just the order the pages will be evaluated in. Variables are defined with a double bracket, then the variable name then double closing brackets.</p>
<h3>default.html</h3>
<p>This is the only required layout file. It determines the main layout of the page. You must include all relevant html tags including &lt;html&gt; and &lt;head&gt;, &lt;body&gt; etc. You should include the following variables inside this page where you need them to go.</p>
<ul>
	<li><strong>css </strong>- Where the list of css files included should go. These tags will be fully formed.</li>
	<li><strong>title </strong>- The title of the page defined in its settings.</li>
	<li><strong>mainContent </strong>- Where you want the main content to go.</li>
	<li><strong>javascript </strong>- Where you want the included javascript to go. This would ideally be right before the closing body tag, but can be wherever makes sense for your website.</li>
</ul>
<h3>intermediarylayout.html</h3>
<p>You can have as many of these as you need to build your pages. These represent a chunk of content inside the generated page. You only need to define the html that is required for your page to work, don&#39;t bother with the &lt;html&gt;, &lt;head&gt;, &lt;body&gt; etc tags. You also only need to define a <strong>mainContent </strong>variable where you want the next item in the stack to go. These layouts can be called anything you want.</p>
<h3>page.html</h3>
<p>The individual page. This can have any name. This will most likely be edited by Edity McEditface through its interface directly. It will always be at the bottom of the stack and therefore does not need to define a <strong>mainContent</strong> variable.</p>
