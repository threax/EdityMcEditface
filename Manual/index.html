<h1>Edity McEditface Manual</h1>
<p>Edity McEditface is a next generation cms that outputs static website content designed to&nbsp;interact with microservices for &quot;server side&quot; functions. The chief goals as as follows:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Natural editing interface.
	<ul>
		<li>Editing a page shows exactly what that page will look like when it is output minus the editing controls.</li>
	</ul></li>
	<li>Produce static content that is native to http and the web.
	<ul>
		<li>Produce fully formed .html, .css and .js files for our output. Any additional static data can be served with raw .json files and accessed with plain http.</li>
		<li>No app&nbsp;processing on the server is required to serve these files.</li>
	</ul></li>
	<li>Development uses static html files.
	<ul>
		<li>Variables can be added to these files, but no logic. Any logic must be written in a javascript file.</li>
		<li>Open and close html tags in the same file. Makes getting correct output much easier.</li>
		<li>Include files by convention. Any page be it a content page or layout can define a .css, .js and .json (for settings) file. These will be automatically detected and used.</li>
	</ul></li>
	<li>Use a linked content system to gather html dependencies.
	<ul>
		<li>Instead of manually including your js and css files define them in a centralized location along with anything they depend on. Then you can refer to this in the page settings for a given page this way the locations and versions of these files can easily change without having to update a ton of different pages.</li>
	</ul></li>
	<li>Separation of CMS backend from deployed version of the website.
	<ul>
		<li>Allows offline content development. Create and edit&nbsp;a website on your local machine and push the output of the compiler to your server.</li>
		<li>Also possible to host the CMS to provide easier collaboration.</li>
		<li>Possibly improve sever security since now you are just serving raw files instead of running a web app with its own potential security holes.</li>
	</ul></li>
	<li>Use Git for version management.
	<ul>
		<li>Can also support other git clients against the repo in case of emergency.</li>
		<li>Utilizes LibGit2Sharp internally.</li>
		<li>Can work in a single shared repo mode or with a repo for each user of the site.</li>
		<li>Enables chains of approval as changes move from one git repo to the next.</li>
	</ul></li>
	<li>NoSql, no database is required to run this program.
	<ul>
		<li>This does not prevent server side development, create a micro service and interact with it on your pages SPA style.</li>
	</ul></li>
	<li>No opinion on client side frameworks.
	<ul>
		<li>Edity McEditface uses the HtmlRapier javascript library with Bootstrap to provide its editing capabilities, but the website being constructed need not use these things.</li>
	</ul></li>
